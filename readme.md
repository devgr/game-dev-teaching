#Easy Phaser Wrapper
The goal of the easy phaser wrapper is to provide a quick way for kids to make simple side scrolling games.

This is a brand new work in progress.

* `index.html` runs testep.js with easyphaser.js
* `game2.js` is a simple game / demo, written in normal Phaser
* `easyphaser.js` is the library that provides easy to use functions and constructs a game
* `testep.js` calls easyphaser functions to make a simple game

# Linux deployment
* Clone repository
* Set up web server and point it to the repository. For example:
    * Intall nginx `sudo apt-get install nginx`
    * Modify the `sites-enabled/default` configuration file to point to the repository directory.
